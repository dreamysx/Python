These python programs implement six main disk scheduling algorithms.
In programs, we assume that the platter has 200 tracks, numbered from 0 to 199 and the disk is currently idle.
You should run your script like this:
python algorithm_name.py input_file.txt
Data in input file sohuld be like this:
Startting track(0-199)
A sequence of requests separated by ",".
